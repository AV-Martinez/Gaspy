# Gaspy
**A gas station finder**

This **Python tkinter** application analyzes the prices of gas stations around a location or along a route. 

It will use public data about gas stations locations and prices to calculate the total cost of a refill based on:

* The distance to the station.
* Its current fuel prices.
* The vehicle's consumption profile
* Any discounts available.

Download all the files to a proper folder and execute:
```
python Gas.py
```
The default language is Spanish, you can change it to English in the **Fichero -> Ajustes** dialog.
