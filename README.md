Gaspy
A gas station finder

This Python application analyzes the prices of gas stations around a location or along a route. 

It will use public data about gas stations locations and prices to calculate the total cost of a refill based on the distance to the station, its current prices, the vehicle's consumption profile and any discounts available.
